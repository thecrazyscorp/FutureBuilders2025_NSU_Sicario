<h2>Problem Statement: </h2>

<h3>The Silent Struggle: Why Medical Support in Bangladesh's Hill Tracts and Rural Regions Remains Hard to find </h3>

In the sprawling greens of Bangladesh's hill tracts and the distant stretches of rural villages, life often moves with a quiet rhythm-yet behind that calm lies a persistent struggle: access to medical support. For millions living in these regions, healthcare is not a guaranteed right but a long-distance hope, often travelling on unpaved roads, across rivers, or through steep, forested terrain.

<h2>Solution Overview: </h2>

In Bangladesh’s hill tracts and rural villages, access to healthcare is often limited by long travel distances, difficult terrain, and unreliable internet connectivity. For many communities, reaching medical support is a time-consuming and uncertain process.

To address this challenge, we built a lightweight web application using basic HTML and CSS with a MySQL-backed backend, ensuring fast loading and accessibility even on low-end devices and weak networks. The system integrates an AI-assisted health triage module that collects patient symptoms, identifies urgency levels, and generates a structured report for doctors.

Instead of replacing medical professionals, the AI acts as a support tool, helping prioritize cases and streamline doctor review. Doctors access assigned cases through a dashboard, review patient medical history, and send diagnoses or recommendations back to patients asynchronously.

This approach enables efficient use of limited medical resources while maintaining safety, simplicity, and real-world usability in low-resource rural settings.

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PHP
Database: MySQL

<h2>AI tools disclosure: </h2>
1. ChatGPT
2. Claude AI

<h2> Handling Limited Internet Access: </h2>
We intentionally kept the system simple and fast: the UI is built with basic HTML and CSS (mobile-friendly), uses minimal JavaScript only for form handling and small interactions, and stores all data in a MySQL database.
