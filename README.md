<h2>Problem Statement: </h2>

<h3>The Silent Struggle: Why Medical Support in Bangladesh's Hill Tracts and Rural Regions Remains Hard to find </h3>

In the sprawling greens of Bangladesh's hill tracts and the distant stretches of rural villages, life often moves with a quiet rhythm-yet behind that calm lies a persistent struggle: access to medical support. For millions living in these regions, healthcare is not a guaranteed right but a long-distance hope, often travelling on unpaved roads, across rivers, or through steep, forested terrain.

<h2>Solution Overview: </h2>
Millions of people in Bangladesh’s hill tracts and rural villages face a critical challenge: accessing timely healthcare. Long travel distances, limited internet connectivity, and a shortage of medical professionals often delay diagnosis and treatment, turning manageable conditions into life-threatening situations.

This project introduces a lightweight, AI-assisted healthcare triage and referral web application designed specifically for low-resource and low-connectivity environments.
